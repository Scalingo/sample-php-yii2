## Dev env

### Install with Docker

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist

Run the installation triggers (creating cookie validation code)

    docker-compose run --rm php composer install

Start the container

    docker-compose up -d

You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

**NOTES:**
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


## CONFIGURATION

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
